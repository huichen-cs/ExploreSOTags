# Exploring Stack Overflow Tags with Hierarchical Topic Models

1. The script at the `SORunScripts` directory shows how the components here are
   related to each other, and how they should be used.  Read the script first.

2. To parse Stack Overflow data set, we leverage on a relational database that
   allows us to parse large data set without having to write parsing programs
   to deal with the insufficient main memory problem.

3. Read the README file in each directory if there is one.
